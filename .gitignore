# docs have been moved to a branch called gh-pages

# Note, if you want to exclude your own machine files from git, you can move the
# machine file path out of the mpf folder and then specify the full path when
# running MPF.

# For example, running MPF with machine files in mpf/machine_files/demo_man:
# mpf demo_man -x -v

# New way, with machine files in some other location:
# mpf c:\my_machine_files\demo_man -x -v
