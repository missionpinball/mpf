        If you add a handlers for an event for which it has already been
        registered, the new one will overwrite the old one. This is useful for
        changing priorities of existing handlers. Also it's good to know that
        you can safely add a handler over and over.

        Args:
            event: String name of the event you're adding a handler for. Since
                events are text strings, they don't have to be pre-defined.
                Note that all event strings will be converted to lowercase.
            handler: The callable method that will be called when the event is
                fired. Since it's possible for events to have kwargs attached
                to them, the handler method must include **kwargs in its
                signature.
            priority: An arbitrary integer value that defines what order the
                handlers will be called in. The default is 1, so if you have a
                handler that you want to be called first, add it here with a
                priority of 2. (Or 3 or 10 or 100000.) The numbers don't matter.
                They're called from highest to lowest. (i.e. priority 100 is
                called before priority 1.)
            **kwargs: Any any additional keyword/argument pairs entered here
                will be attached to the handler and called whenever that
                handler is called. Note these are in addition to kwargs that
                could be passed as part of the event post. If there's a
                conflict, the event-level ones will win.

        Returns:
            A GUID reference to the handler which you can use to later remove
            the handler via ``remove_handler_by_key``.

        For example:
        ``my_handler = self.machine.events.add_handler('ev', self.test))``

        Args:
            event: A string name of the event you're posting. Note that you can
                post whatever event you want. You don't have to set up anything
                ahead of time, and if no handlers are registered for the event
                you post, so be it. Note that this event name will be converted
                to lowercase.
            callback: The method which will be called when the final handler is
                done processing this event. Default is None.
            **kwargs: One or more options keyword/value pairs that will be
                passed to each handler. (Just make sure your handlers are
                expecting them. You can add **kwargs to your handler methods if
                certain ones don't need them.)

        Events are processed serially (e.g. one at a time), so if the event
        core is in the process of handling another event, this event is
        added to a queue and processed after the current event is done.

        You can control the order the handlers will be called by optionally
        specifying a priority when the handlers were registered. (Higher
        priority values will be processed first.)

        Relay events differ from standard events in that the resulting kwargs
        from one handler are passed to the next handler. (In other words,
        standard events mean that all the handlers get the same initial kwargs,
        whereas relay events "relay" the resulting kwargs from one handler to
        the next.)
