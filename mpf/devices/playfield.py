        Args:
            balls: Integer of the number of balls you'd like to add.

                ball(s) from.
            player_controlled: Boolean which specifies whether this event is
                player controlled. (See not below for details)

        Returns True if it's able to process the add_ball() request, False if it
        cannot.

        The source_device arg is included to give you an options for specifying
        the source of the ball(s) to be added. This argument is optional, so if
        you don't supply them then MPF will use the default_source_device of
        this playfield.

        This method does *not* increase the game controller's count of the
        number of balls in play. So if you want to add balls (like in a
        multiball scenario), you need to call this method along with
        ``self.machine.game.add_balls_in_play()``.)

        MPF tracks the number of balls in play separately from the actual balls
        on the playfield because there are numerous situations where the two
        counts are not the same. For example, if a ball is in a VUK while some
        animation is playing, there are no balls on the playfield but still one
        ball in play, or if the player has a two-ball multiball and they shoot
        them both into locks, there are still two balls in play even though
        there are no balls on the playfield. The opposite can also be true,
        like when the player tilts then there are still balls on the playfield
        but no balls in play.

        Explanation of the player_controlled parameter:

        Set player_controlled to True to indicate that MPF should wait for the
        player to eject the ball from the source_device rather than firing a
        coil. The logic works like this:

        If the source_device does not have an eject_coil defined, then it's
        assumed that player_controlled is the only option. (e.g. this is a
        traditional plunger.) If the source_device does have an eject_coil
        defined, then there are two ways the eject could work. (1) there could
        be a "launch" button of some kind that's used to fire the eject coil,
        or (2) the device could be the auto/manual combo style where there's a
        mechanical plunger but also a coil which can eject the ball.

        If player_controlled is true and the device has an eject_coil, MPF will
        look for the player_controlled_eject_tag and eject the ball when a
        switch with that tag is activated.

        If there is no player_controlled_eject_tag, MPF assumes it's a manual
        plunger and will wait for the ball to disappear from the device based
        on the device's ball count decreasing.
