        Args:
            balls: Integer of the number of balls you'd like to add.
            source_name: Optional string name of the ball device you'd like to
                add the ball(s) from.
            source_device: Optional ball device object you'd like to add the
                ball(s) from.
            trigger_event: The optional name of an event that MPF will wait for
                before adding the ball into play. Typically used with player-
                controlled eject tag events. If None, the ball will be added
                immediately.

        Returns:
            True if it's able to process the add_ball() request, False if it
            cannot.

        Both source_name and source_device args are included to give you two
        options for specifying the source of the ball(s) to be added. You don't
        need to supply both. (it's an "either/or" thing.) Both of these args are
        optional, so if you don't supply them then MPF will look for a device
        tagged with 'ball_add_live'. If you don't provide a source and you don't
        have a device with the 'ball_add_live' tag, MPF will quit.

        This method does *not* increase the game controller's count of the
        number of balls in play. So if you want to add balls (like in a
        ball scenario(, you need to call this method along with
        ``self.machine.game.add_balls_in_play()``.)

        MPF tracks the number of balls in play separately from the actual balls
        on the playfield because there are numerous situations where the two
        counts are not the same. For example, if a ball is in a VUK while some
        animation is playing, there are no balls on the playfield but still one
        ball in play, or if the player has a two-ball multiball and they shoot
        them both into locks, there are still two balls in play even though
        there are no balls on the playfield, or if the player tilts then there
        are still balls on the playfield but no balls in play.
