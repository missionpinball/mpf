class ScoreReelController:

    """The overall controller that is in charge of and manages the score reels in a pinball machine.

    The main thing this controller does is keep track of how many
    ScoreReelGroups there are in the machine and how many players there are,
    as well as maps the current player to the proper score reel.

    This controller is also responsible for working around broken
    ScoreReelGroups and "stacking" and switching out players when there are
    multiple players per ScoreReelGroup.

    Known limitations of this module:
        * Assumes all score reels include a zero value.
        * Assumes all score reels count up or down by one.
        * Assumes all score reels map their displayed value to their stored
          value in a 1:1 way. (i.e. value[0] displays 0, value[5] displays 5,
          etc.
        * Currently this module only supports "incrementing" reels (i.e.
          counting up). Decrementing support will be added in the future.

        the length of the list of players. If the player list is longer that
        means we don't have a ScoreReelGroup for that player.
