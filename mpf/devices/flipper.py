        The hardware rules for coils can be kind of complex given all the

        methods to enable the various rules based on the rule letters here,
        which we've implemented below. Keeps it easy to understand. :)

        means that the platform hardware rules will automatically disable a coil
        that has been enabled when the trigger switch is disabled. If False, it
        means the hardware platform needs its own rule to disable the coil when
        the switch is disabled. Methods F and G below check for that feature
        setting and will not be applied to the hardware if it's True.
