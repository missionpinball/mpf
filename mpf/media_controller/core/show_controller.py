        """Plays a Show. There are many parameters you can use here which
        affect how the show is played. This includes things like the playback
        speed, priority, whether this show blends with others, etc. These are
        all set when the show plays. (For example, you could have a Show
        file which lights a bunch of lights sequentially in a circle pattern,
        but you can have that circle "spin" as fast as you want depending on
        how you play the show.)

        Args:
            repeat: Boolean of whether the show repeats when it's done.
            priority: Integer value of the relative priority of this show. If
                there's ever a situation where multiple shows want to control
                the same item, the one with the higher priority will win.
                ("Higher" means a bigger number, so a show with priority 2 will
                override a priority 1.)
            blend: Boolean which controls whether this show "blends" with lower
                priority shows and scripts. For example, if this show turns a
                light off, but a lower priority show has that light set to blue,
                then the light will "show through" as blue while it's off here.
                If you don't want that behavior, set blend to be False. Then off
                here will be off for sure (unless there's a higher priority show
                or command that turns the light on). Note that not all item
                types blend. (You can't blend a coil or event, for example.)
            hold: Boolean which controls whether the lights or LEDs remain in
                their final show state when the show ends.
            tocks_per_sec: Integer of how fast your show runs ("Playback speed,"
                in other words.) Your Show files specify action times in terms
                of 'tocks', like "make this light red for 3 tocks, then off for
                4 tocks, then a different light on for 6 tocks. When you play a
                show, you specify how many tocks per second you want it to play.
                Default is 30, but you might even want tocks_per_sec of only 1
                or 2 if your show doesn't need to move than fast. Note this does
                not affect fade rates. So you can have tocks_per_sec of 1 but
                still have lights fade on and off at whatever rate you want.
                Also the term "tocks" was chosen so as not to confuse it with
                "ticks" which is used by the machine run loop.
            start_location: Integer of which position in the show file the show
                should start in. Usually this is 0 but it's nice to start part
                way through. Also used for restarting shows that you paused.
            callback: A callback function that is invoked when the show is
                stopped.
            num_repeats: Integer of how many times you want this show to repeat
                before stopping. A value of 0 means that it repeats
                indefinitely. Note this only works if you also have repeat=True.
