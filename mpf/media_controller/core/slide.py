class Slide(object):
    """Parent class for a Slide object.

    MPF uses the concept of "slides" (think PowerPoint) as a collection of
    various display elements that should be shown on the display. There can be
    more than one slides defined at any given time, though only one is active
    at any given time. (Unless a transitioning is happening which transitions
    between an old slide and a new slide.

    Args:
        mpfdisplay: The display object this slide is for.
        name: String name of this slide.
        persist: Boolean as for whether this slide should be automatically
            destroyed once it's not shown on the display anymore.
        removal_key: A unique key that can identify this slide for its removal
            later.
        expire_ms: How many ms this slide should live for. Default is 0 which
            means it will not automatically be removed.
        mode: A reference to the Mode which created this slide.

    Attributes:
        name: The string name of this slide.
        elements: List of display elements that are active on this slide.
        surface: Reference to the Pygame surface this slide uses.
        priority: Integer of the relative priority of this slide. Lower
            priority slides won't be shown if a higher priority slide is
            currently active. (A slide of the same priority as the active slide
            can displace it.) Note that 'higher' numbers equal 'higher'
            priority, i.e. Priority 2 is higher than Priority 1.
        active: Boolean as to whether this slide is currently active. Active
            slides will constantly ensure that their display elements are
            refreshed, so this saves CPU cycles by not keeping non-active slides
            up-to-date.
        persist: Boolean as to whether this slide should persist when it becomes
            non-active. A value of False means that this slide will be destroyed
            as soon as it's no longer active.
        width: Width of this slide, in pixels.
        height: Height of this slide, in pixels.
        depth: Integer value of the color depth, either 8 or 24.
        palette: The Pygame palette this slide uses. (8-bit only)
        removal_key: Unique identifier that can be used later to remove this
            slide.
        expire_ms: Integer of ms that will cause this slide to automatically
            remove itself. The timer doesn't start until the slide is shown.
