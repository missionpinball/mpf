        animation: The name of the registered animation element you'd like
            to play
        width: The width of the animation. A value of None means that it
            will play at its native width.
        height: The height of the animation. A value of None means that it
            will play at its native height.
        start_frame: Frame number (based on a 0-index) that this animation
            will start playing from.
        fps: How many frames per second this animation will play. Note that
            it's not possible to play animations faster that your machine HZ
            rate. Default is 10.
        repeat: True/False for whether you want this animation to repeat
            when it's done. Default is True.
        drop_frames: Whether this animation should drop (skip) any frames if
            it gets behind. True means that it will drop frames and skip ahead
            to whatever frame it should be at based on its fps. False means that
            it will always play the next frame, even if it's behind. Default is
            True.
        play_now: True/False for whether this animation should start playing
            now. Default is True.
        x: The horizontal position offset for the placement of this element.
        y: The vertical position offset for the placement of this element.
        h_pos: The horizontal anchor.
