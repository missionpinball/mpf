class BallSearch(object):
    """Base class which implements the ball search functionality.

    This module is responsible for actually firing the coils and moving motors,
    etc. when the ball search begins. It can respond to multiple "phases" of
    ball search. (For example, for the few round it might only do easy things
    like fire pop bumpers. If it doesn't find the ball after that, it will
    start trying to eject balls from ball devices.)

    This ball search module is not responsible for deciding to start or stop
    a ball search--that is something that Ball Controller does. Also this ball
    search module doesn't know when a ball is actually found. If a playfield
    switch is hit then the ball live event will be raised and the ball
    controller will tell this ball search module that it can stop looking.

    Parameters
    ----------

    machine : :class:`MachineController`
        A reference to the instance of the MachineController object.
