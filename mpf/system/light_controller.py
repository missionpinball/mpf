        """Runs a light script.

        Args:
            script: A list of dictionaries of script commands. (See below)
            lights: A light name or list of lights this script will be applied
                to.
            leds: An LED name or a list of LEDs this script will be applied to.
            repeat (bool): Whether the script repeats (loops).
            callback: A method that will be called when this script stops.
            key: A key that can be used to later stop the light show this script
                creates. Typically a unique string. If it's not passed, it will
                either be the first light name or the first LED name.
            **kwargs: Since this method just builds a Light Show, you can use
                any other Light Show attribute here as well, such as
                tocks_per_sec, blend, repeat, num_repeats, etc.

        Returns:
            :class:`Show` object. Since running a script just sets up and
            runs a regular Show, run_script returns the Show object.
            In most cases you won't need this, but it's nice if you want to
            know exactly which Show was created by this script so you can
            stop it later. (See the examples below for usage.)

        Scripts are similar to Shows, except they only apply to single lights
        and you can "attach" any script to any light. Scripts are used anytime
        you want an light to have more than one action. A simple example would
        be a flash an light. You would make a script that turned it on (with
        your color), then off, repeating forever.

        Scripts could be more complex, like cycling through multiple colors,
        blinking out secret messages in Morse code, etc.

        Interally we actually just take a script and dynamically convert it
        into a Show (that just happens to only be for a single light), so
        we can have all the other Show-like features, including playback
        speed, repeats, blends, callbacks, etc.

        The script is a list of dictionaries, with each list item being a
        sequential instruction, and the dictionary defining what you want to
        do at that step. Dictionary items for each step are:

            color: The hex color for the light
            time: How long (in ms) you want the light to be at that color
            fade: True/False. Whether you want that light to fade to the color
                (using the *time* above), or whether you want it to switch to
                that color instantly.

        Example usage:

        Here's how you would use the script to flash an RGB light between red
        and off:

            self.flash_red = []
            self.flash_red.append({"color": 'ff0000', 'tocks': 1})
            self.flash_red.append({"color": '000000', 'tocks': 1})
            self.machine.show_controller.run_script(script=self.flash_red,
                                                    lights='light1',
                                                    priority=4,
                                                    blend=True)

        Once the "flash_red" script is defined as self.flash_red, you can use
        it anytime for any light or LED. You can also define lights as a list,
        like this:

            self.machine.show_controller.run_script(script=self.flash_red,
                                                    lights=['light1', 'light2'],
                                                    priority=4,
                                                    blend=True)

        Most likely you would define your scripts once when the game loads and
        then call them as needed.

        You can also make more complex scripts. For example, here's a script
        which smoothly cycles an RGB light through all colors of the rainbow:

            self.rainbow = []
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ff0000', 'tocks': 1, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ff7700', 'tocks': 1, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ffcc00', 'tocks': 1, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': '00ff00', 'tocks': 1, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': '0000ff', 'tocks': 1, 'fade': True})
            self.rainbow.append({'color': 'ff00ff', 'tocks': 1, 'fade': True})

        If you have single color lights, your *color* entries in your script
        would only contain a single hex value for the intensity of that light.
        For example, a script to flash a single-color light on-and-off (which
        you can apply to any light):

            self.flash = []
            self.flash.append({"color": "ff", "tocks": 1})
            self.flash.append({"color": "00", "tocks": 1})

        If you'd like to save a reference to the :class:`Show` that's
        created by this script, call it like this:

            self.blah = self.machine.show_controller.run_script("light2",
                                                        self.flash_red, "4",
                                                        tocks_per_sec=2)

        """Plays a Show. There are many parameters you can use here which
        affect how the show is played. This includes things like the playback
        speed, priority, whether this show blends with others, etc. These are
        all set when the show plays. (For example, you could have a Show
        file which lights a bunch of lights sequentially in a circle pattern,
        but you can have that circle "spin" as fast as you want depending on
        how you play the show.)

        Args:
            repeat: Boolean of whether the show repeats when it's done.
            priority: Integer value of the relative priority of this show. If
                there's ever a situation where multiple shows want to control
                the same item, the one with the higher priority will win.
                ("Higher" means a bigger number, so a show with priority 2 will
                override a priority 1.)
            blend: Boolean which controls whether this show "blends" with lower
                priority shows and scripts. For example, if this show turns a
                light off, but a lower priority show has that light set to blue,
                then the light will "show through" as blue while it's off here.
                If you don't want that behavior, set blend to be False. Then off
                here will be off for sure (unless there's a higher priority show
                or command that turns the light on). Note that not all item
                types blend. (You can't blend a coil or event, for example.)
            hold: Boolean which controls whether the lights or LEDs remain in
                their final show state when the show ends. Default is None which
                means hold will be False if the show has more than one step, and
                True if there is only one step.
            tocks_per_sec: Integer of how fast your show runs ("Playback speed,"
                in other words.) Your Show files specify action times in terms
                of 'tocks', like "make this light red for 3 tocks, then off for
                4 tocks, then a different light on for 6 tocks. When you play a
                show, you specify how many tocks per second you want it to play.
                Default is 30, but you might even want tocks_per_sec of only 1
                or 2 if your show doesn't need to move than fast. Note this does
                not affect fade rates. So you can have tocks_per_sec of 1 but
                still have lights fade on and off at whatever rate you want.
                Also the term "tocks" was chosen so as not to confuse it with
                "ticks" which is used by the machine run loop.
            start_location: Integer of which position in the show file the show
                should start in. Usually this is 0 but it's nice to start part
                way through. Also used for restarting shows that you paused. A
                negative value will count backwards from the end (-1 is the last
                position, -2 is second to last, etc.).
            callback: A callback function that is invoked when the show is
                stopped.
            num_repeats: Integer of how many times you want this show to repeat
                before stopping. A value of 0 means that it repeats
                indefinitely. Note this only works if you also have repeat=True.
            sync_ms: Number of ms of the show sync cycle. A value of zero means
                this show will also start playing immediately. See the full MPF
                documentation for details on how this works.
            reset: Boolean which controls whether this show will reset to its
                first position once it ends. Default is True.
            **kwargs: Not used, but included in case this method is used as an
                event handler which might include additional kwargs.

    Playlists are useful for things like attract mode where you play one show
    for a few seconds, then another, etc.

    Args:
        machine: The main MachineController object

    Each step in a playlist can contain more than one :class:`Show`. This
    is useful if you have a lot of little shows for different areas of the
    playfield that you want run at the same time. For example, you might have
    one show that only controls a group of rollover lane lights, and another
    which blinks the lights in the center of the playfield. You can run them at
    the by putting them in the same step in your playlist. (Note you don't need
    to use a playlist if you simply want to run two Shows at the same
    time. In that case you could just call :meth:`Show.play` twice to play
    both shows.

    For each "step" in the playlist, you can specify the number of seconds it
    runs those shows before moving on, or you can specify that one of the shows
    in that step plays a certain number of times and then the playlist moves
    to the next step from there.

    You create a show by creating an instance :class:`Playlist`. Then you
    add Shows to it via :meth:`add_show`. Finally, you specify the
    settings for each step (like how it knows when to move on) via :meth:
    `step_settings`.

    When you start a playlist (via :meth:`start`, you can specify
    settings like what priority the show runs at, whether it repeats, etc.)

    Example usage from a game mode:
    (This example assumes we have self.show1, self.show2, and self.show3
