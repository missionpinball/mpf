        From the FadeCandy documentation:

            By default, brightness curves are entirely nonlinear. By setting
            `linearcutoff` to a nonzero value, though, a linear area may be
            defined at the bottom of the brightness curve.

            The linear section, near zero, avoids creating very low output
            values that will cause distracting flicker when dithered. This isn't
            a problem when the LEDs are viewed indirectly such that the flicker
            is below the threshold of perception, but in cases where the flicker
            is a problem this linear section can eliminate it entierly at the
            cost of some dynamic range. To enable the linear section, set
            `linearcutoff` to some nonzero value. A good starting point is
            1/256.0, correspnding to the lowest 8-bit PWM level.

        Args:
            linearcutoff: Float of the new linear cutoff. Default is 0.0.

        From the FadeCandy documentation:

            By default, Fadecandy interprets each frame it receives as a
            keyframe. In-between these keyframes, Fadecandy will generate smooth
            intermediate frames using linear interpolation. The interpolation
            duration is determined by the elapsed time between when the final
            packet of one frame is received and when the final packet of the
            next frame is received.

            This scheme works well when frames are arriving at a nearly constant
            rate. If frames suddenly arrive slower than they had been arriving,
            interpolation will proceed faster than it optimally should, and one
            keyframe will hold steady until the next keyframe arrives. If frames
            suddenly arrive faster than they had been arriving, Fadecandy will
            need to jump ahead in order to avoid falling behind.

        When enabled, MPF will send an update to the FadeCandy on every machine
        tick (regardless of whether there are updates for the LEDs) in order to
        maintain a consistent update rate.

        Note that this setting is written to the FadeCandy's firmware. It will
        persist until it's changed. It is enabled by default.

            our dithering algorithm, this gives a lot more color resolution.
            It's especially helpful near the low end of the brightness range,
