This config folder contains subfolders for different machines. You can use
these as examples to create your own machine. Each machine's folder has further
subfolders for configuration files, machine-specific code, light shows, DMD
files, audio, etc.

There are several machine folders included. None of these are really complete,
but they should give you some various starting points.

If you're new to MPF, start with the tutorial at
http://missionpinball.com/docs/tutorial.

Note that no copyrighted information or intellectual property is included in any
of these files. For example, the Judge Dredd sample machine is not Judge Dredd
per se, rather it is new code unrelated to Judge Dredd which can run on a Judge
Dredd pinball machine.
