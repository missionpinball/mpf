===============================

Let's build a pinball machine!

The Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) is an open source, cross-platform, software framework for powering real pinball
machines.

MPF is written in Python 3. It can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux using the same code and configurations.

MPF interacts with real, physical pinball machines via modern pinball controller hardware such as the Multimorphic
P-ROC or P3-ROC, FAST Pinball controllers, Open Pinball Project (OPP) open source hardware, or Stern SPIKE pinball
machines. You can use it to power your own custom-built machine or to update the software in existing Williams, Bally,
Stern, or Data East machines.

There's also an [MPF Media Controller](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-mc/) (based on [Kivy](http://kivy.org))
which is used to control graphics and sounds, including high-res LCD displays, classic DMDs, and modern RGB LED DMDs.

MPF is a work-in-progress that's not yet complete, though we're actively developing it and checking in several commits a
week. It's MIT licensed, actively developed by fun people, and supported by a vibrant pinball-loving community.

The MPF project homepage is here : http://missionpinball.org
