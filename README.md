What is Mission Pinball Framework?
----------------------------------

Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) is an open source, cross-platform software for powering real pinball
machines in restaurants, bars, arcades, and elsewhere. MPF is developed by fun people under the MIT license, and supported by a vibrant pinball-loving community. It is a work in progress we are actively developing. We review commits weekly.

Technology and Compatibility
----------------------------

You can use MPF to power your own custom-built machine, or to update software in existing Williams, Bally,
Stern, or Data East pinball machines. MPF interfaces with machines via modern pinball controller hardware, including:

* FAST Pinball controllers
* Multimorphic P-ROC or P3-ROC systems
* Open Pinball Project (OPP) open source hardware
* LISY Platform
* Penny K Arcade PKONE
* Arduino Pinball Controller
* Plus many more systems & devices!

MPF is written in Python. It can be run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi host machines using the same code and configurations.

<em>See also the [MPF Media Controller](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-mc/) (based on [Kivy](http://kivy.org)),
which is used to control graphics and sounds, including high-res LCD displays, classic DMDs, and modern RGB LED DMDs.</em>
