Mission Pinball Framework (mpf)
===============================

Let's build a pinball machine!

The Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) is an open source, cross-platform, Python-based
software framework for powering real pinball machines.

MPF is written in Python. It can run on Windows, OS X, and Linux
with the same code and configurations.

MPF interacts with real, physical pinball machines via modern pinball controller hardware such as the
Multimorphic P-ROC or FAST Pinball controller. You can use it to power your own custom-built machine or
to update the software in existing Williams, Bally, Stern, or Data East machines.

MPF is a work-in-progress that is not yet complete, though we're actively developing it and checking
in several commits a week. It's MIT licensed, actively developed by fun people, and supported by a vibrant pinball-loving
community.
