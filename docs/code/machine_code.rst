How to add machine-wide custom code
===================================

MPF contains a "CustomCode" concept which lets you add custom code to your
game.

CustomCode classes are Python modules that run at the "root" of your game. You can
use them to do anything you want.

Note that MPF also has the ability to run custom :doc:`mode code <mode_code>`
which is code that is associated with a certain game mode and is generally
only active when the mode it's in is active. So if you just want to write your
own custom game logic, you'll probably use mode code.

CustomCode classes, on the other hand, are sort of "machine-level" custom code.
CustomCode classes are nice if you have some kind of custom device type that doesn't
match up to any of MPF's built in devices. The elevator and claw unloader
in *Demolition Man* is a good example, and what we'll use here.

(You can read about how to download and run *Demo Man* in the
`example games section <https://missionpinball.org/latest/examples/>`_
section of the MPF User Documentation.)

Here's how to create a custom code class:

1. Create your custom code file
-------------------------------

First, add a ``code`` folder to your machine folder (you can use another name if you
want). Then inside there, create the Python file that will hold your custom code classes.
You can name this file whatever you want, just remember the name for the next step.

In the *Demo Man* example, it looks like this:

.. image:: /images/scriptlet.png

Add an empty ``__init__.py`` file into your folder to make it a package.
It become the package ``code`` and all your classes will be referenced as
``code.file_name.ClassName``.

2. Open and edit your custom code class file
--------------------------------------------

Next, edit the class file you created. At a bare minimum, you'll need this:

.. code-block:: python

   from mpf.core.custom_code import CustomCode


   class Claw(CustomCode):
       pass

Note that MPF contains a ``CustomCode`` base class which is very simple.
(You can see the source of it on GitHub `here <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/blob/dev/mpf/core/custom_code.py>`_.)
We called our class ``Claw`` in this case.

Pretty much all this does is give you a reference to the main MPF machine
controller at ``self.machine``, as well as setup a delay manager you can use
and set the name of your class. There's also an ``on_load()`` method which
is called when the class is loaded which you can use in your own code.

3. Add the class to your machine config
---------------------------------------

Next, edit your machine config file and add a ``custom_code:`` section, then
under there add the package (folder), followed by a dot, then the module (file name) for your class, followed by a dot,
followed by the class name for your class.

For *Demo Man*, that looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   custom_code:
     - code.claw.Claw

This references class ``Claw`` in file ``claw``.py which lives package ``code``.

4. Real-world example
---------------------

At this point you should be able to run your game, though nothing should
happen because you haven't added any code to your code.

Take a look at the final *Demo Man* claw class to see what we did there.
Since custom code classes have access to ``self.machine`` and they load when MPF
loads, you can do anything you want in them.

.. code-block:: python

   """Claw controller for Demo Man"""

       def on_load(self):

           # a ball is there, so we want to get it and deliver it to the claw
