This folder contains the config files for the "your_machine" game which we build
in our Step-by-Step tutorial which is available here:

https://missionpinball.com/docs/tutorial/

Notice that in the "config" folder we have lots of different config files, each
corresponding to what the config file should look like after completing each
step in the tutorial.

In the actual tutorial, each of these files is named "config.yaml", so if you
want to use any of these config files as a starting point, be sure to make a
copy of the file you want and rename it to "config.yaml."

Also note that these files are for a Williams Demolition Man machine controlled by
a FAST Pinball controller, so DO NOT RUN THEM ON A REAL MACHINE until you verify
the hardware, switch, and coil numbers are correct for your machine. Since every
machine is different, if you ran this on some other machine you might end up damaging
your hardware.
