BIG NOODLE TITLING from Sentinel Type, designed by James Arboghast

Hello, and thanks for downloading Big Noodle. Its a pretty simple formula and I
stuck to it - a condensed linear all-caps font for titling, in an unassuming,
squared style. To describe it as modern would be meaningless. 'Modern' started
with Bodoni in the 19th century, and linears have been around since at least
1816. But its definitely 'industrial'. Its also very uniform and utilitarian. So
bland and modular it can be used on almost anything, and that's the whole idea -
its a general purpose font!

Here's what you get:

* Professionally designed commercial quality font
* An upper case (wow!)
* A lower case (see 'upper case')
* Numerals (also called 'numbers')
* Full punctuation, smart quotes, currency, fractions, superiors etc
* Accented Western European characters and a few ligatures
* Windows 1252 Latin 1 character set (see above)
* Fully embeddable for use with Adobe .PDF documents

Big Noodle is a free font, meaning you can use it for any purpose - personal or
commercial. If you make a fair bit of money using it in a big ad campaign,
please send me a royalty payment based on the amount of exposure the work
recieves, and I'll send you a disc of lovely commercial fonts from the Sentinel
Type library in return.

Make the money order or cheque (that's how we spell it in Australia and Canada)
payable to: Maurice Dorisio

Mail cheques to:
14 Albany Place Bulleen
Victoria, Australia 3105

U.S funds are fine, but Australian dollars (AUD $) makes life easier at my end.

Thanks for taking the time to read thru this, and have fun with Big Noodle.


Regards, James Arboghast

James's Fonts

Fonts are cool. If you like fonts, you've probably thought at one time or
another, "I wish I could design a font". That's how this page came about.
These are fonts I've designed.

You are free to use them, although I'd appreciate it if you'd send me an
email telling me what you did with them. You may distribute them providing
you include the readme file and don't chage any money for doing so. You may
not include the fonts on a commercial CD Rom without my permission. All fonts
on this page are the copyright property of James Shields.

I started designing some simple fonts in Corel Draw 3, years ago, but it was
too much like hard work. It's an excellent program, it's just not a font
designer.

The later fonts are designed with Softy, the only Shareware TrueType font
designer I know of. It's a bit basic, but it's an excellent piece of
shareware, and can produce some excellent results if you're persistent.

If you like this font, please write and let me know. My email address is
"jshields@iol.ie".

You can find more of my fonts at "http://www.iol.ie/~jshields/fonts.html".
